# SenseVoice.cpp

[「简体中文」](./README.md)|「English」


[SenseVoice](https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/SenseVoice)SenseVoice is an audio foundation model with audio understanding capabilities, 
including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Language Identification (LID), Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), 
and Acoustic Event Classification (AEC) or Acoustic Event Detection (AED). 
Currently, SenseVoice-small supports multilingual speech recognition, emotion recognition, and event detection capabilities in 
Mandarin, Cantonese, English, Japanese, and Korean, with extremely low inference latency.

This project is based on the [ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml) framework.

## 1.  Features

1.	Based on ggml, it does not rely on other third-party libraries and is committed to edge deployment.
2.	Feature extraction references the [kaldi-native-fbank](https://github.com/csukuangfj/kaldi-native-fbank) library, supporting multi-threaded feature extraction.
3.	Support Flash attention decoding  
4.  Support Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q8 quantization.

### 1.1 Future Plans


1.	Support more backends. In theory, ggml supports the following backends, and future adaptations will be gradually made. Contributions are welcome.

## 2. Usage

### Download Model or Convert Model
You can download the model directly from the links below:

[huggingface](https://huggingface.co/lovemefan/sense-voice-gguf)
[modelscope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/lovemefan/SenseVoiceGGUF)

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/lovemefan/sense-voice-gguf.git
# 或从modelscope下载
git clone https://www.modelscope.cn/models/lovemefan/SenseVoiceGGUF.git
```

Alternatively, download the official model and convert it yourself:
```bash
# Download the official model
git lfs install
git clone https://www.modelscope.cn/iic/SenseVoiceSmall.git
# Convert the model
python scripts/convert-pt-to-gguf.py \
--model SenseVoiceSmall \
--output /path/to/export/gguf-fp32-sense-voice-small.bin \
--out_type f32
```

### RUN
```bash

git clone https://github.com/lovemefan/SenseVoice.cpp
cd SenseVoice.cpp
git submodule sync && git submodule update --init --recursive

mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make -j 8

# -t means thread num
./bin/sense-voice-main -m /path/gguf-fp16-sense-voice-small.bin /path/asr_example_zh.wav  -t 4 -ng
```

### Output

Currently using the sense-voice-f16 model for output:

```
